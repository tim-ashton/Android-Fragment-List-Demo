# Android-Fragment-List-Demo

UI Demo includes (but not limited to):

- Fragment animations on adding and replacement (fragment transition).

- List view with animations on new items added and when scrolling up/down is detected.

- Items are added to a ListView with a worker Fragment.

-Worker Fragment runs a dummy thread which pauses and resumes if runtime changes occur during application state changes.

- Example of fragment layout for landscape/portrait - maintains application state during runtime changes (screen rotation). List view maintains scrolled position.
